P3 Parser

Local Option chosen.

Known issues:
<jump> keyword nodes will throw parse error.
Some nested logic with multiple <start> <stop> blocks may throw parse error.
With multiple different declared variables before <program>, it may throw semantics error when checking scope
validity after checking the first declared variable. It does fine with one declared variable before <program>.

To run program type:

make

then type:

./statSem filename.fs

To clean .o files type:
 
make clean

To clean the .exe file type:

make outclean

Filename must have a .fs extension to be parsed.
